# RRG Test Project (React, Relay & Graphql)

This project has been created to test Graphql, Relay and React components.

## Installation

```
npm install
```

## Running

Start a local server:

```
npm start
```

GraphQL server path will be running on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

App path will be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)


## Developing

Any changes you make to files in the `js/` directory will cause the server to
automatically rebuild the app and refresh your browser.

If at any time you make changes to `data/schema.js`, stop the server,
regenerate `data/schema.json`, and restart the server:

```
npm run update-schema
npm start
```
